# Hard Luck Hard Rock

This is the repository for the website @ www.hardluck-hardrock.dk which was a
band I played in from 1987â€”1994.

We played mostly original heavy rock songs but also some occasional cover tunes,
by e.g. Yngwie Malmsteen, Ozzy Osbourne and Savatage to name a few.

Give me a shout if you ever saw us play :)
